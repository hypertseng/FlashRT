"""What to say when the compiled half is not there.

This distribution is pure Python. It carries the frontends, the structure
catalog, the host adapters and the kernel sources, but no ``.so``: kernels
either arrive through the kernel hub, which the structures layer talks to,
or are built locally for the models actually being run. So the first thing
a fresh install meets is an absent extension, and that moment has to carry
its own instructions — a bare ``ModuleNotFoundError: No module named
'flash_rt.flash_rt_kernels'`` reads as a broken package rather than as a
step the user has not taken yet.

The structures layer already answers this way: a refusal names its reason
and the rung below it. This module gives the native path the same manners.
