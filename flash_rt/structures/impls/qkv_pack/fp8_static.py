"""qkv_pack — pack sibling linears that share one input into one GEMM.

Sibling projections consumed in a fixed call order (q/k/v of an
attention block, gate/up of an MLP) each pay a small-M GEMM whose cost
is launch/latency floor, not bandwidth. Packing their weights into one
``[sum(N_i), K]`` matrix turns the group into a single GEMM; the later
siblings become buffer reads. Two bind forms cover the hosts seen so
far:

- **leaf**: the host calls the sibling modules separately and there is
  no enclosing attention-module boundary. The first sibling's slot gets
  a :class:`PackedLinear` (runs the packed GEMM, writes the other
  outputs into preallocated buffers); the later slots get
  :class:`StashReader` (return the buffer). The host's own call order
  is the data dependency — functionalization keeps copy/read ordered
  inside compiled and captured graphs.
- **module**: the host has an attention module with
  ``q_proj/k_proj/v_proj/out_proj`` attributes and a standard
  projections → attention → out_proj forward. :class:`AttnBlockPacked`
  replaces the whole module: packed GEMM, SDPA at a declared compute
  dtype, original ``out_proj``.

Both forms quantize the packed weight to FP8 with one joint per-tensor
scale (the joint-scale rounding difference is covered by the parity
gate). Inputs enter either as FP8 (a producer seam supplies the shared
``act_scale``) or as BF16 through the fused-quantize entry with a
calibrated ``act_scale``.
