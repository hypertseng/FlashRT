"""qkv_pack in NVFP4 W4A4 with a shared channel balance.

Sibling projections share one input, so under an activation-only
balance they share one balance vector, one dynamic FP4 quantization,
and one packed ``[sum(N_i), K]`` NVFP4 GEMM per call — the structural
form of what a hand-written chain does with a per-forward quantization
memo, held by construction instead of keyed by data pointer. Later
siblings read stashed outputs exactly as the FP8 pack does (the
:class:`~.fp8_static.StashReader` tail is shared; it only needs the
head's stash buffers and guard).

Activation scales are per-block and computed per call, so nothing is
static enough to drift; the calibrated per-channel amax feeds the
balance fold only.
