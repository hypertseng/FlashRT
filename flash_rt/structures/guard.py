"""Runtime seam contract: check it, fall back, and leave a receipt.

A bound structure is calibrated for one execution form — a device, an
input dtype, a width, and for the implementations that preallocate, a row
count. Hand it something else and the honest outcomes are two: refuse, or
run the host's own module instead. The outcome this module exists to
prevent is the third one, where the kernel accepts a buffer it should not
have and the host keeps going with a wrong answer.

Falling back is allowed. Falling back *quietly* is not, because a seam
that always falls back reads exactly like a seam that works: the plan
still lists it, the receipt still counts it, and the latency it was
supposed to buy is simply absent. So every fallback is counted, the first
one per seam says so out loud, and a seam that never stops falling back
takes itself out of the model rather than staying on as a lie.

Three layers, one per timescale:

  per call      the contract is checked; a violation runs the host module
                and increments the seam's ledger
  first time    that seam warns once, naming the path and the reason
  persistent    after ``SELF_DETACH_AFTER`` consecutive fallbacks the seam
                restores the host module permanently and says so

``attach`` collects every guard it swaps in, so ``handle.report()`` is the
one place to ask what actually ran. Tests assert on it: a probe that does
not check its ledger has not checked that the thing it measured was on.

The check runs in Python, so it costs a call in an eager host and nothing
in a captured one — a graph replays the kernel it traced and never
re-enters this code. That is the right way round: the eager host is the
one whose shapes and devices can still change under it.
