"""Auto-assembly: discover seams, calibrate them in one pass, bind them.

This is the distribution layer. Given a host model and a way to run it,
it finds every structure seam (:mod:`.discover`), captures exactly the
calibration each one needs in a single forward pass, and binds each
through its library impl. The caller gets a ``path -> module`` swap map
and any outside-cadence update functions — the same thing the hand
recipes produced, derived from the model object rather than written by
hand. A host integrates by importing and calling; it writes no
per-seam scaffolding.

The calibration each structure needs, captured structure-aware:
  linear_proj / qkv_pack : the shared input the projection(s) see, and
                           its per-tensor amax (the static act scale)
  adaln_producer         : the (cond, style) pairs the conditioning
                           projection emits across the tick, for the
                           step table and its fingerprint locator
  decoder_ffn / vision_ffn : the normed input the MLP sees

Seam negotiation is resolved here: when an adaln_producer feeds a
sibling qkv_pack under the same parent, the producer emits fp8 and the
pack takes the shared act scale, skipping its own input quantization.

    The calibration arguments are the repo's, not this layer's: the names,
    the defaults and the meaning of ``percentile`` / ``max_samples`` /
    ``observations`` are ``flash_rt.api.FlashRT.calibrate``'s, and the
    reduction is ``flash_rt.core.calibration.accumulate_amax``. A second
    vocabulary for the same thing is the one thing this layer must not
    add.

        auto_swaps(model, feed, observations=dataset)      # feed(obs) per obs
        auto_swaps(model, feed, observations=ds, percentile=95.0)

    ``scheme`` names a registered quantisation scheme (:mod:`.schemes`):
    what statistic each point needs, and per seam whether to bind or keep
    the host at host precision. The default ``"auto"`` resolves to the
    highest-performing profile the device can execute — on FP8-capable
    hardware that is ``fp8_static``, bit-identical to the behaviour this
    layer shipped with; elsewhere it is ``none`` (fusion structures
    attach, quantised seams stay at host precision). Explicit selection
    (``scheme="none"``, ``scheme="w4a16_decode"``, ...) overrides. It
    adds no calibration entry.

    ``forward`` is always "run the host once"; with ``observations`` it
    takes one observation. That indirection is this layer's only
    difference from a frontend's ``calibrate``, and it exists because a
    host here is an arbitrary ``nn.Module`` with no common observation
    contract — not because the calibration standard differs.

    ``prefix_cadence`` declares that the caller will run ``plan.updates``
    whenever the observation changes. Structures that hold per-observation
    host state — the attention core keeps the prefix keys and values — are
    only offered when it is set, because without the refresh they attend to
    whatever the calibration saw. Leaving it off is the accurate default.

    On ``percentile``: it reduces *across* samples. Within one sample the
    reduction is a max over every call, which is required rather than
    chosen — see ``docs/calibration.md`` §4.2. And note §10's own caveat
    that at small N a 99.9 percentile barely clips at all (it interpolates
    between the top two ranks); with N ≤ 64 and suspected outliers, pass a
    lower one.
