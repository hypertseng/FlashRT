"""One-call front door: ``structures.attach(model, forward, ...)``.

The consumption contract mirrors ``kernels.get_kernel``: one import, one
call. Everything the structure layer needs — seam discovery, real
distribution calibration, accuracy and net-win gates, transactional swap,
receipt — runs inside the call. An attachment that does not both stay
accurate and win latency is refused; the model is left untouched and the
refusal is reported, never silently absorbed.

Three things about this gate are deliberate, and each replaced something
that used to be assumed:

**It gates what ``auto_swaps`` binds, not a subset of it.** Binding lives
in one place (:mod:`.autobuild`) and this module only judges. The earlier
arrangement had its own binding path covering three structures, so the
one call a caller was told to make was the one call that judged the least.

**The accuracy metric follows the host's output type.** A cosine over a
whole logits tensor falls as the sequence grows while token agreement
rises (see :mod:`.gates`); scoring a language host that way measures
sequence length. Distribution outputs are judged on top-1 agreement and
the last position, value outputs on cosine.

**Latency is judged by paired alternating timing.** Timing one arm and
then the other attributes machine drift to whichever arm it landed on;
this stack has produced an 8% spread between runs of the same
configuration, which is four times the margin the gate is asked to
resolve. Both arms are timed in every round and the decision is the
median of the per-round ratios.

And one thing it checks that nothing used to: after each scoring forward
it reads the attachment's ledger. A family whose seams fell back to the
host module did not run, however good its parity looks — that parity is
the host's own.
