/* Pi0.5 adapters for the generic frt_model_runtime_v1 face.
 *
 * The complete native_v2 producer returned by frt_model_runtime_open_v1
 * declares prompt, state, images, noise, actions, and actions_raw ports. Its
 * graph catalog is infer, decode_only, and context. The selected stage plan is
 * either one infer stage or context followed by an action stage backed by the
 * decode_only graph. Hosts discover those declarations from the returned
 * model; this header does not define a second execution contract.
 *
 * Two lower-level construction paths remain for producer integration:
 *   - create(exp, ...): legacy adapter for an export without a model-runtime
 *     declaration. It creates images/noise/actions ports and one infer stage;
 *     prompt embedding remains producer setup state.
 *   - create_over(model, ...): verb overlay for a producer-owned declaration.
 *     Ports, stage DAG, identity, and fingerprint are inherited exactly. The
 *     complete native_v2 factory uses this path after installing real prompt,
 *     state, image, inference, and action behavior.
